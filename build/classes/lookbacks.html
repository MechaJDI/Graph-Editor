This lab surprisingly went fairly smoothly. After adjusting to new partners for lab 3, we had mostly everything locked down 
for this one. Both the design and code were implemented pretty quickly and painlessly without many problems. Of course, there 
were still a few problems with the complement method, RandomGraph, and CompleteGraph, but eventually they were all worked out 
in a timely manner. I am very happy with the results of this lab and I'm pretty content with my lab partners.

Drew: <br>
I attribute the success of this lab to the very early start we got on the code after our design was approved, as well 
as the excellent distribution of work among the teammates. Both Devlin and Johnathan contributed greatly, providing comments 
and invaluable help with the CompleteGraph and Help systems. They were particularly helpful in the design phase, splitting 
the work evenly three ways. On the whole, this lab was a success, and I hope that future labs will maintain this level of 
excellence.

Johnathan:<br>
The experience with the team as a whole was pretty favorable. Once again, my partners were invaluable in the completion of 
the project due to their ability to program as well as to cooperate with other individuals. Having the same team, less time 
was necessary in coordinating specific tasks to perform and therefore afforded more focus on the code itself. Although the 
design of the two new graph classes seemed pretty straightforward, the code itself required a bit more work than anticipated. 
Even with this slight setback however, a bit of creativity eventually solved the problem.

Team: <br>Though largely a success, this lab was not without issues. Namely, while the equals methods for nodes and edges worked 
perfectly, the method removeAll() in ArrayList refused to use it, so we were forced to replicated its functionality in a 
linear search. In addition, for unknown reasons, Complete and Random graphs do not support saving and opening, though they 
export to .png flawlessly. We also had some initial confusion with regards to drawing the nodes in a circle for those two 
classes, but Dr. Yanushka's advice answered our questions. Lastly, in the spirit of randomness, RandomGraph now also has the 
ability to randomize the colors of the nodes and edges and the sizes of the nodes. We believe that this adds to the 
randomness of the RandomGraph class. To have random graphs randomize color and size, either start the program with the argument "y" or select the "Randomness" item from the Edit menu.
