This is a simple Graph Editor with the following features:
Drag and drop node and edge placement
Random graph creation
Reversing of directed edge graphs
Completion of a graph
Saving and restoring of graphs

Currently there is a bug with edge placement when running through an IDE but the included GraphEditor.jar file runs flawlessly as an executable of the code. Seeing as this project was completed a couple of years ago, familiarity with the code is a bit sketchy at the moment.
